# Change log

## Installed my good old friend cascadia code
-   using Cascadia Code NF
-   jetbrains can FRO

## changed from default gnooome terminal to wezterm
-   Kitty and Alacrity are better but:
    -   Alacrity's currently supported versions run on ubuntu 23/24, so we have mint being lazy problem
    -   Kitty seems hatder to install
    -   wezterm is easiest to install, plug and play MF
    
-   termianl feels faster already!
